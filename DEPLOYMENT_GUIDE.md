# ðŸš€ Free Deployment Guide - Railway

This guide will help you deploy your Comments Collator backend to Railway's free tier and publish your plugin to the Figma Plugin Store.

## Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway (Free)

### 1.1 Sign up for Railway
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Login" â†’ "Login with GitHub"
3. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub account

### 1.2 Create New Project
1. Click "New Project" 
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Choose this repository: `Comments-Collator-Plugin`
4. Click "Deploy Now"

Railway will automatically:
- Detect your Node.js app
- Install dependencies
- Run the build command (`npm run migrate`)
- Start your server

### 1.3 Configure Environment Variables
In your Railway dashboard:

1. Go to your project â†’ "Variables" tab
2. Add these environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=./database/comments.db
FIGMA_CLIENT_ID=your_figma_client_id_here
FIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET=your_figma_client_secret_here
WEBHOOK_SECRET=secure_random_string_here
JWT_SECRET=another_secure_random_string_here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
API_BASE_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app
FIGMA_API_BASE_URL=https://api.figma.com/v1
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

**Important:** 
- Replace `your_figma_client_id_here` and `your_figma_client_secret_here` with your actual Figma app credentials
- Generate secure random strings for `WEBHOOK_SECRET` and `JWT_SECRET` (use a password generator)
- Replace `your-app-name` with your actual Railway app subdomain

### 1.4 Get Your App URL
1. In Railway dashboard, go to "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
2. Your app will be available at: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
3. Test it: `https://your-app-name.railway.app/health`

## Step 2: Update Figma Developer App

### 2.1 Update OAuth Settings
1. Go to [Figma Developer Console](https://www.figma.com/developers/apps)
2. Select your existing app
3. Update the callback URL to: `https://your-app-name.railway.app/auth/figma/callback`
4. Add your production domain to allowed origins if needed

### 2.2 Configure CORS and Redirect URI
Add these environment variables in Railway (update the previous ones):

```
FIGMA_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-app-name.railway.app/auth/figma/callback
CORS_ORIGIN=https://www.figma.com
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://www.figma.com,https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

## Step 3: Update Plugin Code

### 3.1 Update Backend URL in Plugin
The plugin code needs to use your production URL instead of localhost.

**File:** `code.js` (line 2)
```javascript
// Change this line:
const BACKEND_URL = 'http://localhost:3000';

// To your Railway URL:
const BACKEND_URL = 'https://your-app-name.railway.app';
```

### 3.2 Test Production Backend
1. Update the code in Figma
2. Try the authentication flow
3. Verify comments sync correctly

## Step 4: Prepare Plugin for Store

### 4.1 Create Plugin Cover Image
Create a 400x300px cover image for your plugin:
- Use Figma to design it
- Export as PNG
- Show the plugin interface or comment collation feature
- Keep it clean and professional

### 4.2 Update Plugin Manifest
Ensure your `manifest.json` has:
```json
{
  "name": "Comments Collator",
  "id": "your-unique-plugin-id",
  "api": "1.0.0",
  "main": "code.js",
  "ui": "ui.html",
  "networkAccess": {
    "allowedDomains": ["https://your-app-name.railway.app"]
  },
  "permissions": ["currentuser"]
}
```

## Step 5: Submit to Figma Plugin Store

### 5.1 Prepare Submission
1. Go to [Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community)
2. Click "Publish" â†’ "Publish Plugin"
3. Upload your plugin files:
   - `manifest.json`
   - `code.js` 
   - `ui.html`
   - Cover image (400x300px)

### 5.2 Plugin Description
